# Better Auth configuration - Placeholder
# Note: BetterAuth doesn't have a Python/FastAPI server-side implementation
# This is a placeholder to avoid import errors when the package isn't available
# The actual authentication is handled by the auth.py module

# Create a placeholder app since BetterAuth doesn't have Python server-side support
from fastapi import FastAPI
auth_app = FastAPI()

# The auth instance can be used for additional configuration
